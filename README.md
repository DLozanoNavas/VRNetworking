This project is being develop by using Unity 5. It consist on a VR representation of "The down of the Net" the popular Networking video. This project is intended for high school students at Tunja, Colombia, so Audio assets are expected to be in Spanish until translation, but for uniformity and academic reasons, we're going to keep this project's development pipelines in English. 

We're using Google VR library and standard assets due to its simplicity. For 3D modeling and animation we're using Maya and 3D Studio, both by Autodesk. As seen, this project is being written in C#. We're using agile development and git for source control. For Dev+Testing we're using Visual Studio 2017, Unity Tools for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Online Services.
